# Sudoku
The elusive Sudoku generator! This project was a lot of fun.  I used a neat idea of having every square represent an array of the numbers 1-9. When a number is put into a square, it will remove that number from the arrays of the col row and section it is a part of.  It also must pick a random square with the lowest possible numbers.

This is my first time working with OOP. I find it neat and tidy and I had a lot of fun writing this. I enjoy the fact that I can create an entirely new instance of my sudoku so easily.
